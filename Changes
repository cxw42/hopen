Revision history for Data-Hopen

0.000020    ??
    - Breaking changes in Data::Hopen::G::GraphBuilder:
        - Replace scalar node property with arrayref nodes property
        - goal/default_goal(): connect all nodes to the goal
    - Breaking changes in Data::Hopen::G:
        - Remove Data::Hopen::G::Op --- it didn't add anything over ...::Node,
          so just use Node directly.
    - Data::Hopen::G::Runnable::_run() can now return undef, and ...::run()
      will replace it with {}.
